1.The client-side axios.post call sends a POST request to the Express server at the /api/v1/user/register endpoint.

2.The Express server receives the request and uses the routing middleware (app.use('/api/v1/user', userRoutes);) to direct the request to the appropriate route handler in userRoutes.js.

3.The registerController in userCtrl.js processes the request, handling registration logic (e.g., validation, database operations).

4.The server sends a response back to the client, which handles it accordingly (e.g., showing a success or error message).
